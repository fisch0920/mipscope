OLD:

   * Add 'Find and/or Replace' Dialog
   * Better view of errors
   * Make MemoryView!
         Use dynamically-updating pBuffers for texture; get 2d texture-version working correctly first

   * Fix Restarting very fast and then segfault



   * DELAYED parsing!!!
DELAYED Parsing Ideas:
   * Main thing is updating of syntaxErrors; ErrorConsole
      * fix multiple calls to contentsChanged (inserting whitespace on Return press)

   * Know whether last errors were syntactic or semantic; attempt to use that intelligently
      * Attempt to only re-add parseNodes if non-trivial changes were made
