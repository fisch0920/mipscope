TEST FILES --

mazetest.c: doubly linked list, depth first search
mazetest2.c: doubly linked list, breadth first search
mazetest3.c: singly linked list, breadth first search (the one I am implementing in asm)

ASSEMBLY FILES --

asm/maze.s -- mazetest3.c ported to spim using our nice friendly syscalls

The Makefile is currently configured to make the "mazeq" binary out of mazetest3.c.

MAZE FILES --
Hand-built ones:
 test.mze - a perfect maze (without any loops or inaccessible areas)
 welcome.mze - a 'cute' maze with an embedded message (see if you can find it!)
 small.mze - a tiny maze for sanity testing
 template.mze - an unsolvable maze (also useful for making more hand-built ones)

Maze generator: mazegen.py, generates perfect mazes of any size
 (uses a depth-first random path-digging algorithm)
